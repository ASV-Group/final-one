# Project Name: Future-Proof-Prep

## Project Overview

Future-Proof-Prep is a modern, AI-powered platform designed to help users prepare for interviews. It leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a comprehensive preparation experience, including a real-time chatbot, posture analysis, and interview simulations.

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with a modern frontend stack:

- **Framework**: React with Vite for a fast development experience.
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for a beautiful and consistent component-based design.
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation within the single-page application.
- **AI/ML**:
  - Google Gemini API for the intelligent chatbot functionality.
  - TensorFlow.js for real-time posture detection and analysis during practice sessions.

The backend consists of a simple Express server to handle requests to the Gemini API securely.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd future-proof-prep-main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses npm as the package manager.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## How to Run Locally

After following the setup instructions, you can run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## APIs or Endpoints

The application communicates with the Google Gemini API through a backend proxy. The primary interaction is with the generative language model to power the chatbot.

## Example Inputs/Outputs

-   **Chatbot**:
    -   **Input**: User types a question, e.g., "What are common questions for a software engineer role?"
    -   **Output**: The chatbot provides a detailed answer generated by the Gemini API.
-   **Posture Analysis**:
    -   **Input**: User's webcam video stream during a practice session.
    -   **Output**: Real-time feedback on posture, such as "Sit up straight" or "Look at the camera."
